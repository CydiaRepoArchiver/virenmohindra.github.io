	                    <p>
	                    	<div class="item" align='left'>

   	                    <p>
Equipped with a computer science degree from Carnegie Mellon, Aparna worked at Goldman Sachs in USA and Merrill Lynch in Switzerland in the technology and private banking sectors. From building trading, reporting, risk applications for fixed income in New York to building banking wide systems for the private bank in Geneva with teams of developers, working in tandem with her, she went onto becoming a discretionary wealth portfolio manager. She won many awards for her technological work as well as various philanthropic endeavors during her career at Goldman and Merrill.

<br><br>
Her personal life brought her to Mumbai where she has employed her innumerable and diverse talents to start a language academy that teaches French and Spanish, has co-authored a guide to living in Mumbai, chaired and is the executive lead for a not for profit expat network and very recently has become co-founder of KoffeePlace, a startup e-portal for professional women.
<br><br>
An avid traveler, a linguist, a voracious reader, and an art aficionado with a spirited sense of fashion, she now combines her zeal for all things exquisite, her observation of the e- commerce space globally, and her conversance with the world of technology to create a platform for every user’s aspiration to experience life in subtle elegance which resonates with their individual perspective towards their unique personality and personal definition of style.

	                    <div class="item" align='left'>

	                    <p>
With a degree from St Xavier’s College and technical training from Sophia Polytechnic, Rasna began her professional career as an Interior Designer and worked with distinguished names in the multifaceted Mumbai housing space before moved to New York city. In NYC, after a short stint at the Fashion Institute of Technology, she set up a beading and embroidery production house and partnered with several New York designers. Whether in home interiors or clothing and accessories, style to her is a reflection of how an individual aesthetically, artistically and spiritually relates to the world. Attuned to design via the senses by means of fragrances, visuals and patterns, her creativity is inspired by a spectrum of things, ranging right from architectural structures to the more innate flora and fauna around her.<br><br>
Having immense regard for the Indian craftsman, who pour their soul into hand-crafting marvelous creations, she believes in the country’s potential to produce artists who can lend global trends to fashion. Herself endowed with a classic sense of style, Rasna now unites her artistic sensibility, penchant for exclusivity and understanding of various body types, skin tones or home spaces to curate bohemian, chic, whimsical and avant-garde looks for a platform that will provide personalized solutions to the user’s unceasing search for effortlessly experimenting with and experiencing the circle of life.

Serving in various capacities in a wide array of projects and programs has won her numerous awards, accolades and certifications in both her educational and professional pursuits.<br><br>
A trained classical dancer with a diploma in Hindustani music, a zealous reader with a passion and flair for creative writing and editing, she has a proclivity towards detail, a relaxed and befitting sense of style and an austere view on aesthetics. Having witnessed the transformation in this industry, she now amalgamates her own expectations as a user of the online trade community with her meticulous business acumen, her knowledge of the operational excellence required to deliver quality and her understanding of an individual’s intrinsic and extrinsic personalities to build a platform where talented providers fulfill style aspirations and enable each identity to luxuriously transit between the phases and occasions of HIS, HER or ITS life.
